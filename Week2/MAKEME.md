# Homework Week 2

```
Topics discussed this week:
• Async vs Sync
• Event Loop (order of execution)
• Promises
```

## Step 1: Read

- Read this article on scopes & closures: [explaining-javascript-scope-and-closures](https://robertnyman.com/2008/10/09/explaining-javascript-scope-and-closures/)

- If you are still not completely clear on promises, here are some additional nice resources :ring:

    - [Googles post about Promises](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/promises)
    - [A nice article from David Walsh](https://davidwalsh.name/promises)
    - [A real life example](https://github.com/mdn/js-examples/blob/master/promises-test/index.html)
    - [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13343340/calling-an-asynchronous-function-within-a-for-loop-in-javascript)
    - YouTube: [promises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBupia9oidU)


## Step 2: Feedback

- Create at least 2 issues (bug / feature / code improvement) on another student's GitHub repository.
- Solve the issue(s) proposed by another students in your GitHub repository. More info [here](https://hackyourfuture.slack.com/files/michahell/F31BX1XT6/Merging_a_local_branch_into_master).

## Step 3: Promises

_Deadline Saturday_

The assignment for this week is:

- Complete your GitHub app code as needed to meet the requirements from the assignment of week 1.
- Replace all asynchronous callbacks (e.g. as used with XMLHttpRequest) by ES6 promises.
- Beautify your app's styling.

## Step 5: Read before next lecture

Go trough the reading material in the [README.md](/Week3/README.md) to prepare for your next class.
